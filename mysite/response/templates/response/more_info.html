    first personal computer to be sold without a programming language.[60] Its debut was signified by "1984", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[61] This is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[62] and was called a "masterpiece" by CNN[63] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.[64][65]
    In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the

        Macintosh sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months due to its high price, slow speed, and limited range of available software.[66][67][68][69]:195 In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired two years earlier by Jobs[70][71] using the famous line, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?"[72] Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the general manager of the Macintosh division, and gained unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[73][70]
        
        The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.[74] Informed by Jean-Louis Gass√©e, Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called an emergency executive meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[74] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT Inc.[75] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years".[12][11][76] Despite Wozniak's grievances, he left the company amicably and both Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders.[77] Wozniak continues to represent the company at events or in interviews,[11] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year for this role.[36]
        
        The outlook on Macintosh improved with the introduction of the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer, and PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application released in July 1985.[78] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter, and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[79]
